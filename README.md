# Tinytooltip Fan Fix for Dragonflight

Current Dragonflight fixes for Pre-patch, come Launch of Dragonflight it will break tooltips even more (it will not load images on the tooltip) when that fully comes out I will attempt to fix it (no guarantees)

I am not the author, just someone who plays WoW and fixes addons that are either abandoned or not updated frequently
